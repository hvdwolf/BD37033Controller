# BD37033 Sound Controller for Jerking UxyyyN[D][2] car radios

Currently a work in progress, no testing beyond the fact that it builds.
This will need to be installed in /system/priv-app/
This will also require library /system/lib/libjni_i2c.so to be renamed to /system/lib/libjni_i2c_moved.so in order to block sofia server from accessing it.
